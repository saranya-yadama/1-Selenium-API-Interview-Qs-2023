1)Access Modifiers;

Default: methods/variables can be accessed anywhere only inside that particular package
Public: methods/variables can be accessed anywhere across all the packages
Private: methods/variables can be accessed only inside that particular class. can't be accessed outside the class of same package
Protected: methods/variables can be accessed (anywhere inside that particular package)+(inside the sub/child classes) => default + (inside the child classes)

only way to access methods/variables outside of package is to use either public or protected with inheritance

2)Where do we use finally block in automation?
To close the browser once the execution of test case is completed. even if the Test case is passed or failed
Also to delete the cookies of current session

3) Is there any way where finally block will not get executed?
it will not get executed when we stop JVM forcefully (i.e., by clicking stop or terminate button in IDE)

4) one try block can be followed by multiple catch blocks
finally/catch should be the immediate block after try
